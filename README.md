# ceng546-simulation
A small non-interactive visual simulation game written in Java.  
  
This is actually a programming assignemnt to teach OOP, Design Patterns and UML. I have uploaded my solution here to insipire people with new ideas and for a reference on how to use some important design patterns. You can find the project description in the HW1_546.pdf.

#### Compilation and Running
In the ./source directory, just type:  
```
$ javac *.java
$ java Simulation
```
You should be able to see the simulation up and running.

#### Javadoc
I have generated a Javadoc for a clean reference to almost everything in the project. You can access it from ./docs/javaDocs/index.html

#### Class Diagram
I have also created a detailed class diagram for the project. It can be found under ./docs/class_diagram/ folder.
